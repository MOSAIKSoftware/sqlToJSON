How to use:

You can use this as a grunt task (see ./Gruntfile.js) and also as a standalone
library (see ./example/index.js).  
For testing purposes you can start the sample database via:
- `docker network create sqltojsonnetwork`
- `docker-compose up`

The important configurations are in `./config.json` (for the standalone use) or directly in the `Gruntfile.js`.
